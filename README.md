### ðŸ“‘ About
**Email client** with GUI has been implemented. After starting program, a login window appears in which user enters his login and password, enters the parameters of IMAP and SMPT servers, and can turn on _the autoresponder_ for the selected period. Program receives emails (refreshes every 30 seconds) and allows user to view and send them. Also there is _a filter_ of received messages by keywords using intelligent word analysis (model used: sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2).
**Created using:** PyCharm 2022.2.4 (Professional Edition) | Python 3.10.9 (WinPython 3.10 Release 2022-04)
